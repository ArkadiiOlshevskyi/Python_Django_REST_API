Welcome to the "PYTHON DJANGO REST API" project for the Todo Page. This project is designed to help you advance your skills in the Python Django Rest Framework and showcase your capabilities to future employers. The project will be deployed on an AWS server, accessible via its own HTTPS domain. The goal is to provide a contemporary and minimalistic web service that offers various features.

## Stack

- AWS EC2
- AWS SQL Database
- AWS Database (Storage) for Images
- Python Django Rest Framework
- Figma (For GUI Design)
- JavaScript (Solid Framework)
- Redis
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- Prometheus
- Grafana
- Elasticsearch
- Kibana
- Sonar

## Deployment

To deploy the "PYTHON DJANGO REST API" Todo Project with the specified stack, follow these high-level steps:

### Step 1: Setting Up AWS Resources

1. **Create an AWS Account**: If you don't have an AWS account, sign up for one.

2. **Configure AWS CLI**: Install and configure the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) on your local machine to interact with AWS resources.

3. **Create an RDS Instance**: Set up an AWS Relational Database Service (RDS) instance for your Django application's SQL database. Configure the database instance with the required settings, such as database type, username, password, and security group.

4. **Create an S3 Bucket**: Set up an Amazon S3 bucket to store static assets and images. Configure the bucket's permissions and access control.

### Step 2: Django Application and Figma Integration

1. **Develop Django Application**: Build your Django application, including the REST API for the Todo Page. Configure settings for connecting to the AWS RDS instance.

2. **Figma Integration**: Integrate Figma designs into your Django project's frontend. Use the designs to create responsive and appealing user interfaces.

### Step 3: Backend Deployment with Docker

1. **Dockerize the Application**: Create Docker containers for your Django application, including the required dependencies. Write a Dockerfile for each service (Django, Redis, etc.).

2. **Docker Compose**: Use Docker Compose to define and manage multi-container Docker applications. Define services, networks, and volumes in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

3. **Test Locally**: Test your Dockerized application locally using Docker Compose. Make sure all services are communicating correctly.

### Step 4: Deploying to AWS with Kubernetes

1. **Amazon EKS**: Set up an Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) cluster. This will be your Kubernetes environment to orchestrate and manage your containers.

2. **Kubernetes Deployment Configs**: Define Kubernetes deployment configurations for each service in your application. These configs specify how many replicas of each container to run, resource limits, environment variables, etc.

3. **Load Balancing**: Set up a Kubernetes LoadBalancer or Ingress resource to expose your application to the internet.

### Step 5: Domain Setup and HTTPS

1. **Domain Registration**: Register a domain name for your application through a domain registrar.

2. **AWS Route 53**: Use Amazon Route 53 to manage DNS records for your domain. Create DNS records to point to your Kubernetes LoadBalancer or Ingress.

3. **SSL Certificate**: Obtain an SSL certificate using AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) for your domain to enable HTTPS.

### Step 6: Monitoring and Logging

1. **Prometheus and Grafana**: Set up Prometheus for monitoring and Grafana for visualizing metrics. Configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from your application and other services. Create dashboards in Grafana to monitor key performance indicators.

2. **Elasticsearch and Kibana**: Deploy Elasticsearch and Kibana to manage and visualize logs. Configure your containers to send logs to Elasticsearch and set up Kibana dashboards for log analysis.

3. **Sonar**: Implement Sonar for load measurement and performance analysis. Monitor application response times, request rates, and other performance metrics.

### Step 7: Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

1. **Set Up CI/CD Pipeline**: Implement a CI/CD pipeline using tools like AWS CodePipeline and CodeBuild. Connect your GitHub repository to automatically build, test, and deploy changes to your Kubernetes cluster.

### Step 8: Monitor and Scale

1. **Monitoring**: Use Prometheus and Grafana to keep track of your application's health and performance. Set up alerts based on predefined thresholds.

2. **Scaling**: Configure Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler to automatically scale your application based on resource utilization.
